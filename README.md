# DSLR
The dslr project of 42

In this project we have a csv file full a student and their grades in differents subjects in Harry Potter universe.

![DSLR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6eb6cd14-169e-462e-97ea-3afa90b7f9f2)

We have to make a classification gradient descent to find the house of new students from their grades.

First we find our utils data to perform our regression.

Next we run our train program and save our model.

Finally we can predict the next class.
